# Hillenbrand Example Branch

The Android app I showed in Lawson, example for basic frontend and data dump. If your computer has cloud backup, you may want to compile with that turned off for this folder. Flutter should compile for IOS with the same code. I'll try to write up a better app for data dump, and anyone else is welcome to take a crack at it. Super stoked!

Note that Fluter's code entry point (where the important stuff is) is in `/lib/main.dart` where root is the project folder, `indoormap_app`. Note that the first flutter build will take many minutes because it has to download large libraries for geospatial data. Happy hunting!
